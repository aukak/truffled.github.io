    <h3>What happened?</h3>
    <p>
      On July 11, 2023, we at Mercury Workshop 
      received a notice from Google, informing us 
      to take down both the downloads for the SH1MMER 
      bins and the website builder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not wanting to deal with the legality of it all,
      we had no choice but to comply with what they 
      requested from us, and the builder &amp; bins have 
      been taken offline.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doesn't mark the end of things, but it does
      mean that we can no longer provide a place for users
      to download SH1MMER bins nor build a injected shim.
